# STL files
All parts here should be 3D printed, recommended material PETG at 50% infill and 3 perimeters. You will also need some parts machined out of plywood on a CNC machine.

Depending on the exact setup you want to create and the parts that are available to you you may need to modify some parts. Check the STEP folder to get solid CAD files and the assembly of the project. Everything is designed to be quite modular and adjustable to different tripods.
